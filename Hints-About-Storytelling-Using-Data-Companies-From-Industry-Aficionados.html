I thought to myself 'I should write about that too!' however then I thought that there are far too many ideas here to include in one blog post: I would have to write a series of them.

Stories are meant to bring meaning, feeling, and context to concepts that are dry and lifeless by themselves. The art of  <a href='https://www.thestorymill.co.uk/'>storytelling for business</a> comes down to the timing of the story being told. <br /><br>Data comes to life when you add language-based context to it too. The possibilities are countless, thats why our stories are not predefined, and each of the users decisions has consequences. When you read them a story, you can do a review or ask them to recall some of the details. This atmosphere of play and creative expression creates an appetitefor more similar experiences. Maybe  <a href='https://www.thestorymill.co.uk/data-storytelling/'>storytelling with data</a> is the answer for you?<br /><br>A primary requirement for the development of a character in film or literature is for the character to change in an arc across the story so that the presented experience has an effect that is mirrored in the development of the character.
